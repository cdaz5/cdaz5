Hi, I'm Chris. I'm a software engineer who loves to create small open source projects and write blog posts about all things code.  To learn more about me or read some of my posts head on over to [chrisdascoli.dev](https://chrisdascoli.dev/).

I work @ [Milo](https://getmilo.com/). Yup, we write software that helps those who help animals.. does it get any better?
